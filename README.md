# AutobahnReact
Make realtime a breeze with React and Autobahn.

## Installation - quick setup
You just have to `npm install autobahn-react` to start using it.

## Tutorial and docs
A tutorial (which cover all of the doc) will be soon available through a readme.io website.
It is finished, I just have to wait that readme.io accept this project as an open source one.
Sorry for the inconvenience.

Soon !
