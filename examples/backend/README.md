Example backend
===============

You need to install crossbar router in order to start the backend, and thus run all examples.

To do so: `npm run install-crossbar` will do it.
Or `sudo pip install crossbar`

(Assuming that you use Python 2.x's pip)

After that, just run : `npm run start`

Don't forget to install dependencies.
